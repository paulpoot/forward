# Forward

This is an opinionated [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate that features a bunch of configurations that I enjoy developing with.

## Features

- Next.js with strict Typescript setup
- Storybook
- Jest and Testing Library
- SASS
- normalize.css
- Husky with Commitlint set to conventional commits
- A whole bunch of linting
- clsx for easy combining of classnames
- A folder structure that should cover pretty much everything you want for most larger projects
- Setup for custom fonts
- A few ready-to-use components, like a meta, heading, spacer and text component
- Default layout setup
- A media query context that can be used to determine screensize in Javascript
- A basic setup for global styling and variables
- A throttle util function

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
