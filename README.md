This is an opinionated Next.js setup featuring a few defaults that I often implement in my projects.

## Features
- Strict Typescript setup for optimal maintainability
- Storybook for optimal component based development
- Contentful integration with a typescript generator to automatically create types
- SVG Sprite Loader for using SVG icons as a spritemap
- Next sitemap for creating sitemaps
- classnames for easier styling
- Normalize.css
- QA script for code quality testing

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
